# @wandelbots/nova

The Wandelbots Nova client library provides convenient access to the Nova API from frontend JavaScript applications. In addition to typed methods for each API endpoint, we provide some higher level abstractions that manage the websocket connection state for tracking robot movement and handling jogging and program execution.

```bash
npm install @wandelbots/nova
```
